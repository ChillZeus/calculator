Calculator for back to school

This is basically just me seeing if I can make some, useful, practical stuff in Javascript. My first project that's not just a bunch of printing to the console or a basic HTML page, but more of a real web app.

Status: We got single digit adding, subtracting, dividing, and multiplying and the display now works! Only supports 2 numbers
